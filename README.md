# Landslide-Prevention-and-Innovation
==============================

## Brief Description: 

Hong Kong, one of the hilliest and most densely populated cities in the world, is frequently hit by extreme rainfall and is therefore highly susceptible to rain-induced landslides. A landslide is the movement of masses of rock, debris, or earth down a slope and can result in significant loss of life and property. A high-quality landslide inventory is essential not only for landslide hazard and risk analysis but also for supporting agency decisions on landslide hazard mitigation and prevention.

The common practice of identifying landslides is visual interpretation which, however, is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Thus, this project will focus on automating the landslide identification process using artificial intelligence techniques, and target at using high-resolution terrain information to perform the terrain-based landslide identification.. The challenge is part of the [Zindi Competetion](https://zindi.africa/competitions/landslide-prevention-and-innovation-challenge).
